# hello_world
Introductory repository creation with the classic "Hello World"
I studied statistics in college, sort of in ignorance of what it was for. I did not do a lot of career building, or preparation of any sort. I though just going to school was what you need to succeed. Not that case. 
Anyway, now I'm trying to catch up to my more well-prepared peers. 


Cheers.
